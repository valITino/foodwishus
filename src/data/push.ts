// Three parties are involved. The browser holds the subscription (an address at its push
// service plus keys) and the permission. The cloud holds a copy of the address, so it
// knows where to send, and the list of muted kinds. And the cloud has the kitchen's
// public key, which a browser needs to sign up; without one, notifications are not set
// up yet. PushControl keeps all of this in step and remembers on the device what was
// chosen and which key it last saw, so a choice made offline is not lost.
//
// The browser's side sits behind PushDevice, so the logic here can be unit-tested and
// the end-to-end tests can stand in for a push service.
